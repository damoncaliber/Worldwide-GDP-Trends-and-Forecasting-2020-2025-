# Global Economic Pulse: A GDP Analysis and Forecasting Study

![World Map]()

## INTRODUCTION
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) serves as the primary gauge of a nation’s economic vitality — capturing the total value of goods and services produced within its borders. It not only reflects current performance but also reveals how economies evolve, recover, and compete on the global stage.

Measured through production, income, and expenditure approaches, GDP provides a 360° view of economic activity and living standards. Real GDP adjusts for inflation to track true growth, while GDP per capita highlights individual prosperity.

Between 2020 and 2025, the world economy underwent historic disruptions and transformations. This project analyzes and forecasts global GDP trends to uncover how different regions responded to these shifts — revealing patterns of resilience, inequality, and long-term recovery shaping the next phase of global growth.

### Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis and forecasting of global GDP between 2020 and 2025, uncovering patterns that define the post-pandemic economic landscape. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling, this study aims to translate raw economic indicators into meaningful insights that support data-driven understanding of global growth.

#### Key objectives include:

* Trend Exploration: Examine year-over-year GDP changes to uncover structural shifts, growth cycles, and global recovery trajectories.

* Regional Performance Analysis: Identify high-performing and underperforming regions, evaluating how different economies adapted to external shocks.

* Comparative Growth Assessment: Analyze disparities in growth rates between developed and emerging markets to understand global convergence or divergence.

* Time-Series Forecasting: Apply statistical and machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA) to forecast GDP growth trajectories for the near future.

* Insights & Implications: Derive actionable economic insights and policy implications that reflect the evolving global financial landscape.
 
#### Data Overview

The dataset used in this analysis contains global GDP data spanning from 2020 to 2025, capturing the economic output of countries and regions during a period defined by recession, recovery, and restructuring of the world economy.
It provides a valuable foundation for exploring both macroeconomic performance and regional disparities across the post-pandemic landscape.

Each row in the dataset represents a specific country and year combination, containing both nominal and real GDP values expressed in current USD. The data supports cross-country and temporal comparisons, enabling multi-level trend, distribution, and growth analyses.

## DATA CLEANING & PREPROCESSING

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

### Global & Structural Overview 

How did the composition of global GDP (by region or income group) shift between 2020 and 2025, and what does this suggest about economic power realignment?

To what extent did GDP concentration (top 5 economies vs the rest of the world) increase or decline, and how does that relate to global inequality or dependency?

Did the 2020 recession cause a lasting structural break in global GDP growth, or did economies revert to pre-pandemic growth trajectories?

Which regions showed the strongest resilience or elasticity during contraction and recovery phases, and what factors appear to explain this resilience?

### Regional and Country-Level Dynamics

How consistent or volatile was GDP growth across continents, and which regions experienced the highest volatility-to-growth ratio (risk-return trade-off)?

What patterns emerge when comparing emerging vs developed economies — are emerging markets catching up, stagnating, or diverging further?

Which countries experienced GDP rebounds that outpaced pre-pandemic baselines, and what policies or sectors may explain that overperformance?

How do resource-driven vs service-driven economies differ in recovery speed and sustainability from 2020-2025?

### Temporal & Seasonality Analysis

Are there recurring seasonal or quarterly patterns in GDP that reflect production or consumption cycles?

Are global recessions and rebounds synchronized or asynchronous — do smaller economies lag or lead global cycles?

How does GDP volatility evolve over time — does economic stability return after the pandemic, or is volatility the new normal?

### Drivers & Correlation Analysis

Which macro-indicators (inflation, unemployment, interest rates, investment, exports) most strongly correlate with GDP growth — and do these relationships change over time?

Is the relationship between inflation and GDP linear, or does it show threshold effects (e.g., GDP rises until inflation exceeds a certain point)?

Are high-growth countries characterized by lower unemployment elasticity (i.e., growth that doesn’t translate to jobs)?

### Inequality & Structural Imbalances

Did the gap between high-income and low-income countries widen or narrow post-2020?

Which economies improved in GDP per capita ranking, and does this correlate with better social development metrics (if available)?

How does GDP concentration (e.g., share of top 10 economies in global total) evolve — is global growth inclusive or top-heavy?

Are smaller economies more sensitive to global shocks than larger ones (elasticity of GDP change relative to world GDP change)?

## FORECASTING & PREDICTIVE MODELING.

Based on ARIMA/SARIMA/SARIMAX forecasts, which countries are projected to lead global growth by 2026–2027?

Are there regional clusters where forecasts indicate cyclic convergence or divergence (e.g., Africa catching up vs Europe plateauing)?

What are the uncertainty bands (confidence intervals) of future GDPs, and which economies have the widest forecast uncertainty?

How do forecasts compare when including vs excluding exogenous macro-variables (SARIMAX)?

Which model best captures real-world GDP behavior — and what does that say about the underlying economic structure?

## INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

What do the trends tell us about economic resilience and policy effectiveness?

Are we witnessing a structural realignment of global growth drivers (e.g., tech vs commodities vs services)?

What do the results imply for investors, governments, or global institutions like the IMF or World Bank?

Are current growth rates sustainable given inflation, debt, and resource constraints?

How should countries adapt policy to avoid stagnation or dependency in the next economic cycle?
